# lap-1-project-server-side

Back-end for the futureproof LAP1 project

### Change log

For heroku, the 'start' script seems to be linked to heroku, hence it should only contain the node command, not others such as nodemon.

### Requests

GET:

- (/) - gets all messages
- (/:id) - gets messages by their Id's

POST:

- (/post) - posts body from client onto the database

add these to the base URL to make a request
